### Week 1 

Fundamental data and collab skills - command line, comunicating science, R, meta-analysis and data management

A community document, review, contribute, etc. good for collaborative work.

### Networks and Servers

Network - physical or other connection between computers.

Local network - physical connection, area network is > 2 comps. All computers are equally connected. Broadcast - sending a message, 

Routing network, e.g., connecting networks through routers, routers know how to send info across networks. Router network may not be linear.

Each host (e.g., personal comp) has an IP address, we use NCEAS address for workshop (it changes)
```{r eval = T}
system('ipconfig', intern = T)
```

Connect to remote server (NCEAS):
```{r eval = F}
ssh myname@aurora.nceas.ucsb.edu
```

Then enter password.
