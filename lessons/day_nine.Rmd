### Reproducible research

Provenance - origin and processing history of data:

* Audit trail
* Attribution/credit
* Replication and reproducible research
* Discover of data, methodologies, experiments

National Climate Assessment is **transparent**

KNB framework promotes provenance. 

Recordr R Library for recording provenance of data

For provenance, we need to know for any given script/workflow, what's the output and what's the required input.  

Look here for tutorial on uploading provenance data: <https://github.com/NCEAS/oss-lessons/blob/gh-pages/publishing-data/upload-data.Rmd>
