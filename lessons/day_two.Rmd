### Version control: git basics

Distributed - you have the entire history of a git project on your local machine, applies to everyone working separately on a the same project. 

See the git manual:
```{r}
system('git', intern = TRUE)
```

See your global configurations:
```{r}
system('git config --global --list', intern = TRUE)
```

Save your user credentials:
```{r eval = F}
# forever
system('git config --global credential.helper cache', intern = TRUE)

# for an hour
system("git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600'", intern = TRUE)

```

Show hidden files using `ls -a`, show files recursively `ls -R`. Look into cygwin or commander for a good windows shell.  

`git clone` copy a remote repo to your local machine (or server)

`vim favorite_desserts.csv` creates a file and enters the interactive text editor.  Enter text as needed.  To exit, press esc, `:w` to save, `:q` to quit.  
 
 Or enter text from command line. 
 ```
 echo 'line 1, line 1' > favorite_desserts.csv
 ```
 To append to a file, use two carets `>>`.
 
 `git diff` shows what's changed since last commit. 
 
 `git checkout -- filename` will revert a file back to its version in a previous commit.
 
 Putting a git repository on Aurora, login to Aurora with new Git Bash shell:
 `ssh beck@aurora.nceas.ucsb.edu` (to exit server execute `exit`)
 
 Then run: `git clone https://github.com/fawda123/myrepo.git` in whatever directory on Aurora. 
 
 To see a file tree in Git Bash `cmd //c tree`

### Communicating your research

* Know your audience
* Frame your message
* Lead with results
* Avoid jargon

Create a hook, make it resonate

The message box - lets you distill the message, target differnt audiences.  For the issue, id the problem, so what, solutions, benefits *do it in this order!*:

* The issue: overarching topic, frames the rest of the box
* The problem: the part of the big picture you're addressing, often the research question, sets you up for so what?
* The so what: why your audience should continue caring or listening to you, like a prism where message goes through and exits depending on the audience
* The solution: outlines options to address the problem, can your address use these solutions? 
* The benefit: what benefits come from addressing the problem. Must connect with the so what.

Making your message stick - no numbers!
