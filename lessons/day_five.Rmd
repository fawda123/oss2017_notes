### Meeting Facilitation: A simple decision making technique

Extremes of facilitation - Robert's Rules (formal, e.g., motion to decree, etc.) to flip board brainstorming (informal, disorganizing)

At DataOne - sticky dos and sticky dots
* Sticky dos (notes) - give 4-5 notes per person, one idea per note, then go around in order to read notes, one idea per turn, repeat/refine
* no discussion at time of idea, do not go out of order, no consolidation w/o discussion
* Sticky dots - each person gets 3-5 dots, use the dots to identify top three options, then vote by putting dots by ideas on notes

The person with the pen yields the power, don't let this bias the group!

Primary dataset vs derived dataset - latter is a clean dataset from existing data.
