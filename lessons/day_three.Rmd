### Unix command line tools

Use this for bash commands in Rmd ` ```bash ` ` ``` `

Text editors for Unix systems - vim, emacs, or nano, all run from CLI.  For example, run this to start the text editor: 

```bash
~$ nano myfile.txt
```

Then use `Ctrl + ` something to run commands, `^` is for ctrl.  

RStudio can also be used on aurora to edit files.  

Other useful unix commands:

* `wc` count lines, words, characters
* `diff` compare files
* `sort` sort lines in a file
* `uniq` report/filter repeated lines in a file (`sort` must be used first)

Unix commands are `stdin` for input data, then two streams out for `stdout` for normal output and `stderr` for error output (`std` is standard).  There are operators to manipulate those in/as a pipe `|`.  You can choose to do different things with the output.

For example, redirect the standar error (second pipe) to some null place: 

```bash
$ ls fakefile.txt 2> dev/null
```

Don't forget to check manual for options: 
```bash
man grep
```

Nest functions in Unix: `<(sort paleo-mammals.txt)`

To go up a directory `../../mydir` goes up two directories to `mydir`
