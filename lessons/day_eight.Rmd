### Data munging, qaqc, cleaning

dplyr, tidyr stuff - `separate`, `gather`, `spread`

### Scientific workflows

GitHub is not an archive!!!!

Zonodo is a public archive - more for software?  

Reproducible Science has analytical transparency, automated analyses, archived and shared. It's also about modularity - one task, one component of the workflow.  It's also about provenance.  

Workflow software - Kepler, Galaxy, etc. 

Function name is a verb that shows what is done... This lets the analysis workflow be displayed as action verbs (think in pipes).

Workflow diagrams are color-coded - red are data, purple are automated, yellow are data healing (usually manual) - look into Unified Modelling Language!

### Writing functions

Scoping - how much a function does, should be a minimal unit.
